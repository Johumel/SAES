stlist_ignore  --> use this to list stations to ignore
wvtype --> use this to list wave types. Then set wvtype1 to 'P' and wvtype2 to 'S'
showfc2 --> this should be used to turn on showing fc2 on the plot
sumtype --> use this to set up how you want to sum the spectral ratios (weighted, mean or median; default: median)
remove_resp --> use this to turn on instrument response removal for spectral ratio. Whether you turn this on or not, if the station changed over time, instrument response will be removed for spectral ratio
freesurface_cor --> to turn on removal of free surface (True or False)
