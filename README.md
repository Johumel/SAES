# Spectral Analysis for Earthquake Source (SAES)
This (SAES) code is intended to perform a spectral analysis to calculate earthquake source parameters, 
i.e. corner frequencies, and long-period spectral amplitude. More details on how to get started please see this [manual](https://github.com/Johumel/SAES/blob/master/SAES_Manual.pdf).
