# STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!
# Spectral Analysis for Earthquake Source (SAES) Parameters
This code is intended to perform a spectral analysis to calculate earthquake
source parameters, i.e. corner frequencies and source dimensions, assuming
a circular patch.

## INSTALLATION
```
python setup.py install
```
## USAGE
```
from saes import saes_saes_core
```
